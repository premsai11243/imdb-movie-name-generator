What started as innocent curiosity turned into a life-altering nightmare. A classmate had vanished without a trace, and determined to solve the mystery, the group ventured deep into the town's forbidden woods. There, they discovered something far worse than they could have imagined: Romanova, a witch of unspeakable evil, centuries old and fueled by dark rituals that involved sacrificing children to expand her immense powers. That night, the friends narrowly escaped, but they lost one of their own-a friend who would never come home. The trauma of what they saw and experienced haunted them, even as they grew older and went their separate ways. Now adults, Luís remains tormented by memories of Romanova and what happened that night. While the others have tried to bury the past and move on, Luís has spent years obsessively researching the witch's origins, her power, and the lore that surrounds her. Convinced that Romanova was never truly defeated, Luís believes she is preparing to rise again. His obsession turns into grim validation when strange events begin to occur in their hometown. Children are disappearing once more, and eerie signs-symbols carved into trees, whispers in the dark, and shadowy figures-indicate that Romanova's power is returning. Desperate to stop the witch before she fully regains her strength, Luís reconnects with Sabrina, Rogério, and Vasco. Reluctant at first, the group's fears are reignited as Luís reveals unsettling evidence. Together, they return to the place that has haunted them for years: the woods where it all began. But the Romanova they face now is stronger, more vengeful, and far more dangerous. As their bonds are tested and long-buried secrets resurface, Luís and his friends realize they are not just fighting to stop Romanova-they're fighting to survive. The line between past and present blurs as the friends confront their childhood trauma, uncover dark truths about Romanova's origins, and come face to face with their deepest fears. Luís, driven by guilt and revenge, must make an ultimate sacrifice to destroy the witch before she consumes more innocent lives. But Romanova is cunning, and her power has grown beyond anything they expected. As the final confrontation looms, the group discovers that defeating her may require more than they're willing to give. Will Luís and his friends succeed in breaking Romanova's curse, or will they become part of her dark legacy, doomed to be forgotten like so many before them?",Horror
