However, the trucking industry is notoriously cutthroat, filled with fierce competitors and entrenched interests that don't take kindly to newcomers. Mia quickly realizes that the legacy she's inherited is fraught with challenges. The former owner's old business partners are skeptical of her abilities and are eager to undermine her. They see her as an easy target, someone who can be easily intimidated into giving up her claim.

With the weight of her newfound responsibilities pressing down on her, she must confront her own limitations while striving to prove to everyone, including herself, that she can lead this empire.

She learns the ins and outs of the trucking business, forges unexpected alliances with loyal employees, and faces off against ruthless competitors.

She wants her son to replace her on the board of the family business, Dagogo Marine and Engineering, which is headed by his late father's best friend, Chief Gabby Dagogo. Tega is a socially conscious young man who quickly realizes that his family business is a cesspit of corruption and a hub of everything wrong with Nigeria, particularly in the power sector. His closest friends-Bob, Ken, and Jez-come from more humble backgrounds but are not spared from the effects of energy corruption in high places. A damaged power transformer in their ghetto neighborhood leads to a series of tragic incidents, culminating in the loss of a child during childbirth. In reaction, the residents rise in protest against agents of the power company who come to disconnect their electricity due to unpaid debts. During a scuffle, one of the agents falls, hits his head on the ground, and dies. Meanwhile, a gathering of Chief Dagogo's friends reveals they are the juggernauts controlling Nigeria's energy sector-from generator importation to diesel supply, and across the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil industry, among other areas. Tega soon clashes with the company when he uses his position to intervene in the police case arising from the death of the power company agent. This intervention brings more trouble for Tega, who subsequently uncovers secrets indicating that his family business is deeply entangled in the organized crime that dominates Nigeria's oil, gas, and power sectors. Determined to dismantle the corrupt power behemoth at all costs-even if it jeopardizes his family's fortunes-Tega enlists the help of his friends. However, their efforts are soon discovered by the underworld power brokers and movers in the energy sector, who are connected to ruthless global oil cartels. Tega and his friends are lured into a trap and imprisoned in a warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Their only hope of survival lies in Abo, the only daughter of Chief Dagogo, and Bozzo, the leader of an independent private army maintained by Tega's mother. Will they survive this perilous mission, which pits this small David against the Goliath of international oil cartels operating in Nigeria's power sector?",Action
